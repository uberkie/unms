A php script that gets the throughput from a airmax 8.5 device in a json format  and displays it on a graph om a web server.
The login script was copied from here https://community.ui.com/questions/Login-to-web-interface-with-PHP/d9f86a22-d1d5-47d5-be10-b738bcf51809#answer/61e8b1a6-628f-411e-a86d-15b2e9b1c1aa
The chart.php does a url call to the airmax.php and renders the graph. Any sugestions feel free as Im not a programer this is just something that I needed to make life
easier
